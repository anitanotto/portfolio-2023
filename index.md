I'm a software engineer based in Central Virginia with experience working for non-profits and small businesses and I'm looking for new opportunities. 

I specialize in Javascript development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. But, my greatest skill is learning new tech stacks quickly and efficiently, and I'm looking to join a new team where I can learn more and continue to grow as an engineer.

I enjoy making websites with minimalist layouts so they are both beautiful and efficent.
