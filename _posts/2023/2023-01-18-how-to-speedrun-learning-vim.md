Yesterday a friend that's going into a DevOps bootcamp asked me what I thought of one of the first projects they're having to do since they need to learn Linux, and it seemed to me just like something to get them familiar with the command line.

They casually mentioned Vim and I told them it is important to learn the basics so you can edit files on the servers you're sshing into, but, I didn't expect the next day for them to be frustrated that they were not really taught what a lot of the basic commands are or how they work. I know it's a meme and all, but, they literally didn't teach them how to quit - they had to figure that out themself.

I guess I was lucky to learn all that on my spare time for fun because I thought Vim was cool and interesting and not have to learn it on a deadline, but, I learned the basics from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cu45aM3C2DJVGfCjSBB1yD9YkC7q27-) if you're interested in educating yourself.
