description: The best part of JavaScript using other languages.

When learning JavaScript, the coolest thing was how you could use the same language for both the front and back ends of your web app.

So I was really excited to randomly learn that [Web Assembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) is a thing that lets you do that with other languages - plus since it is part of the web standards, the MDN has docs for it.

I'm interested in learning Rust, so, I think it would be good practice to translate some of my current applications to using it for both the front and back end or it would be pretty easy to use building a web app as a way to learn more about the language.
