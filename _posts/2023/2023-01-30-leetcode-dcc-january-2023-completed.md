My last answer for this month's challenge just got accepted - here's what I learned for the momth.

First off, there were so many problems in the month that could be solved by depth first search - this really reinforced how vast the number of problems you can solve with just one algorithm for me. It was nice that the early problems eased you into using it in more complex ways, but, I lost count of how many you could use dfs to solve.

Second, there's not really a lot of people doing some of these problems with JavaScript. It was really beneficial to look at code from other languages, and I learned a lot about C++, Python, and Java from doing so.

Finally, I just learned that I could actually finish the whole month, and I'm looking forward to next month and also getting into learning other languages.
