A friend sent me [this link](https://startafuckingblog.com/) and it reminded me of the glory of Web 1.0.

The nostalgia of the pre-social media internet really made me think about how I should be creating content when I can build my own websites. Interacting with social media is a drain and a chore, but building out your own site is the greatest... so, posting everything on your own site and just using social media to spread it seems like the best of both worlds.

Plus, having another project to tinker with and upgrade will be fun and a good opportunity to learn more stuff. Eventually I'd like to get an RSS feed running so I can automate all the posting so I just have to deal with this site.

I plan to post here about things I am learning and projects I am building.
