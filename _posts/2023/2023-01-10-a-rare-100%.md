I was pretty surprised, but, I managed to get my first Leetcode solution that beats 100% of the other JavaScript solutions on runtime.

Now, not a lot of people seem to do some of these problems with JS, but, it still feels great! Because of that though, maybe in the future I can write some guides on translating things from C++ and Python to JS - I've been learning a lot from looking at code in those languages now that I know what different syntax means in relation to JavaScript.
